                    of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                    Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked.
